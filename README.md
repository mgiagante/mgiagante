## Well, hello there! 👋

- 🌱 I’m currently learning Zero-Knowledge Proofs
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on Rust, Solidity & cryptography projects.
- 🤔 I’m looking to help with code, documentation, tests and any other tasks that can help improve the quality of projects that favor individual freedom, privacy and positive social change.
- 💬 Ask me about FOSS, cryptography, natural rights, intellectual property, asado (Argentinean BBQ), kung fu.
- 📫 How to reach me: [My Linkedin profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mgiagante/)
- 🐦 I (reluctantly) tweet from [@macro_rules](https://twitter.com/@macro_rules) 
- ⚡ Fun fact: I can speak some Cantonese.
